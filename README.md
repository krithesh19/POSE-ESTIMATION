# POSE-ESTIMATION
Pose Estimation Project
Welcome to the Pose Estimation Project! This project is designed to explore and implement pose estimation techniques for analyzing and understanding human or object poses in images or videos. Whether you're interested in computer vision, machine learning, or applications in fields like sports analytics, healthcare, or robotics, this project aims to provide a foundation for learning and experimentation.

Features:
Pose Detection Algorithms: We implement state-of-the-art pose detection algorithms, allowing you to analyze and extract key points from images or video frames.

Scalable Architecture: The project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing easy integration with different datasets, models, and applications.

Real-time Pose Estimation: Explore real-time pose estimation capabilities for applications such as fitness tracking, augmented reality, or interactive installations.
